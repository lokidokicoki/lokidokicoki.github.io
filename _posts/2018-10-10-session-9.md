## Date 719HE/E25
After a spot of lunch, the team continued to explore the rest of Deorctheng. Eventually they descended in the lowest level of the dungeon.  They encountered a fiendish lever puzzle, which only with the cunning we have come to expect did they manage to solve.

Once they had completed the first half of the puzzle, the team battled with a large group of Zarg cultists, a fierce fight, but with an inevitable conclusion. Post a brief rest to tend to their wounds, the team entered the final room. 

A horrific sight confronted them, priests of Zarg and a monstrous fleshy construct, howling and mewling in terrible pain.

Our valiant heroes emerged, and to them the spoils of battle, a slim black rapier which Ulunuuh seems drawn to…

The plucky band returned to the relative quiet of the tower proper and took a well earned rest.
